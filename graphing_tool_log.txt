I got st.radio buttons to show df_2 columns. looks good.

I have an x_axis (will be called 'x') that picks the column from DF_2, now I need to enter that x
into all the places it needs to. 

I added a number entering widget to select the number of columns that the graph will have

Added some y-axis st.widgets. 
Tried to revisit the methods of creating df_2 from df_1. 
    It was a transposition of the columms.

button_trial.py
Changed the y-axis number to "How many plots (plots) you would like on the graph"

Todo: pick the y-axis columns to be plotted

## 5/2/25
Added iteration code to the num of plots needed. 

To to: add plotting canvas, then iteration over data to be plotted onto the canvas 

## 5/3/25
changed the structure a bit. 

## 5/4/25
Wrote a working code

## 5/5/25
Want to add functions to add units. 
idea: a (yes/no) toggle switch which then activates a text box to add your units
