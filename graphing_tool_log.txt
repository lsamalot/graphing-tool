I got st.radio buttons to show df_2 columns. looks good.

I have an x_axis (will be called 'x') that picks the column from DF_2, now I need to enter that x
into all the places it needs to. 

I added a number entering widget to select the number of columns that the graph will have

Added some y-axis st.widgets. 
Tried to revisit the methods of creating df_2 from df_1. 
    It was a transposition of the columms.

Changed the y-axis number to "How many plots (plots) you would like on the graph"

Todo: pick the y-axis columns to be plotted
